StoryDev
========
This is an engine and interactive story editor in-one to develop games with a focus on story.

You may find it easier to install this product, without the source code, by downloading the [ZIP file from MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/#!UZcSRKiS!zVciEpogoY4MbgEgmAnL63AA5_U3NIFC5H1Vh1BMRdg).

Getting Started
===============
Before you can use this Editor, you will need Windows XP Home Edition or later with the .NET Framework 4 (or later) installed. To compile your video game, you are also going to need to install the Haxe Toolkit along with LIME and OpenFL. Firstly, visit the [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) website and download the latest Haxe toolkit. When downloaded, install the package.

Once this is done, open Command Prompt, and follow the instructions on the [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/setup/install-lime/) website.

If Lime or OpenFL does not appear to install correctly, and you check this by typing in `haxelib list`, then there may be a problem with access permissions. Reinstall the Haxe Toolkit, and open Command Prompt in Administrator Mode, then attempt to follow the instructions again.

Haxe Toolkit may also run into problems if you have Stencyl installed on your computer. If this is the case, you may need to remove Stencyl and reinstall it at a later time so that Stencyl does not interfere with the installation.

Once this is all done, you will need to also install the following libraries, by typing in the following commands into Command Prompt:

1. `haxelib install msignal`
2. `haxelib install hscript`

These are both required by the engine for it to compile successfully. Any problems may be reported here in the Issues, or the best place would be to report them onto our [forums](http://www.colour-id.net/apps/forums/).
